I am currently a Postdoc in the [Algorithms, Data Structures and Foundations of Machine Learning research group](https://cs.au.dk/research/algorithms-data-structures-and-foundations-of-machine-learning), headed by Prof. [Kasper Green Larsen](https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/) at [Aarhus University (Department of Computer Science)](https://cs.au.dk/).


a PhD student in Department of Computer Sciences at University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Ilias Diakonikolas. Before joining UW - Madison, I received my BS from Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University, where I was advised by Professor Yitong Yin in the Theory Group. I'm broadly interested in theory of machine learning and algorithms. My recent work focuses on algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics and information-computation tradeoffs for statistical estimation.
