I am currently a Postdoc in the [Algorithms, Data Structures and Foundations of Machine Learning research group](https://cs.au.dk/research/algorithms-data-structures-and-foundations-of-machine-learning), headed by Prof. [Kasper Green Larsen](https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/) at [Aarhus University (Department of Computer Science)](https://cs.au.dk/).
I completed my PhD in [Department of Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ilias Diakonikolas](http://www.iliasdiakonikolas.org/).
Before joining UW - Madison, I received my BS from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University, where I was advised by Prof. [Yitong Yin](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/) in the [Theory Group](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/). I'm broadly interested in theory of machine learning and algorithms. My [PhD thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/96f0a601637edd04412a5234de1d9bc5/1?casa_token=MCDzXBoLUIAAAAAA:HLdvU8VOXyQX_3lyuG0oBQ5GlJr6_SNuWl84z-n9hZP0uQb71Oi1UmQd-cHdMElqcO-bOsE&cbl=18750&diss=y&pq-origsite=gscholar) focuses on algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics and information-computation tradeoffs for statistical estimation.
